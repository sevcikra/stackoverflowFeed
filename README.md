Script to set up regular weekly mailing containing chosen tag questions as appeared on http://www.stackoverflow.com.

Setup

* SMTP authentication details - add folder `/auth` containing a text file `key.txt` with 2 lines of text (email and password) for SMTP login
* if needed you can change the requested tag
* setup Windows Task Manager / Cron to execute the script regularly (e.g. weekly)

Thanks
